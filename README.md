# SysMon Microservices Platform

A modular system monitoring and feedback platform built with **FastAPI**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL** using a microservices architecture.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… JWT Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- âœ… Microservices for User, Feedback, and Metrics
- âœ… Central API Gateway with request routing and JWT verification
- âœ… React Admin Dashboard with user management and system status
- âœ… Docker-based deployment
- âœ… OpenAPI docs with secure Bearer token auth support
- âœ… Health & version endpoints for observability

## ðŸ§± Architecture

- `api_gateway/` - Routes external requests to appropriate microservices
- `user_service/` - Manages user registration, login, and roles
- `feedback_service/` - Handles feedback submissions and admin views
- `metrics_service/` - Provides system-level metrics and status
- `frontend/` - React-based admin dashboard (Role: admin, user, viewer)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Spins up the full system locally
